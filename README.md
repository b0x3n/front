# Testbed

Update - __/06/2024__

The project started today, I just created this repo and pushed the skeleton demo app on git pages.

This repo contains the code for a static website/application - __this is not the final project__, it's designed purely for _testing_ and _demonstration_ purposes.

The goal at this stage is fairly simple. I want to create a user interface that mimics an old-style computer terminal. This interface will provide a platform for a much larger project in the future.

I need to create a sort of terminal emulator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main objective now is to write modules to handle input and output, we need to be able to create a terminal that is divided into a grid of _character cells_ that can be individually rerferenced using line/column co-ordinates (think __ncurses__).

Visit https://b0x3n.github.io/front for more information and to view/test the app in its current state.

Once  I'm satisfied that the system works properly I can move onto __phase two__ of the project, more on that later!
