 *
 * To keep things neat and orderly I've divided the scss
 * files into separate directories:
 *
 *      pre/
 *      style/
 *      post/
 *
 * Each of these directories has an __include.scss file
 * which will import all other files in that directory.
 *
 * The pre/ directory essentially stores files that
 * define values that are used throughout the application,
 * for example pre/_fonts.scss defines the core fonts
 * used in the application.
 *
 * The style/ directory stores the regular .scss files
 * where basic styles elements are defined.
 *
 * The post/ directory contains .scss files that should
 * be compiled last, such as media queries.
